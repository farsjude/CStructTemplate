# C Struct Template

This is a simple C code template that demonstrates how to create and work with structs in C. It's a great starting point if you're learning C or need a quick reference for creating structs in your own projects.

## Description

This project shows how to define a struct, dynamically allocate memory for it, and manipulate its members. It's fully editable and can be easily customized to suit your needs.

## How to Compile and Run

1. Make sure you have a C compiler installed (e.g., GCC).
2. To compile the code, run the following command:

   ```bash
   gcc CStructTemplate.c -o CStructTemplate

## Known Issues/Considerations:
Data type portability: The long data type may vary in size across platforms (e.g., 32-bit vs 64-bit systems). The longNumber field might not behave consistently in all environments.
Print format specifier: Ensure you're using the correct format specifier based on your platform's long size (e.g., %ld for long, %lld for long long).
